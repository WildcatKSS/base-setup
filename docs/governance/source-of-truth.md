## Rule

Do not duplicate full rules across many documents.

When editing governance:
1. Update the canonical source.
2. Add only short references elsewhere.
3. Avoid creating another document unless the topic has no clear owner.

## Documentation Style
Canonical source: `docs/governance/documentation-style-guide.md`
